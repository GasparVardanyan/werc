Werc Development
================

The latest dev code is available in the werc mercurial repo: <https://code.9front.org/hg/werc>


Version Numbering and Branching Rules
-------------------------------------

There is no such thing! Originally a convention similar to that of the Linux kernel was used, but it is easier to do incremental work on a single branch.

For radical or experimental changes the `werc-dev` branch might be used, but at the moment it is outdated.

Bug reports, feature requests, bug fixes and other patches are all very welcome, just send them to the [werc mailing list](http://lists.9front.org).
